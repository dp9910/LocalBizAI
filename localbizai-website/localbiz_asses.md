# LocalBizAI Business Assessment Framework

LocalBizAI is an intelligent AI tool trained specifically for your business needs. We solve the problem where generic AI gives technical answers without understanding your business context.

## Our Methodology

We create customized AI solutions by combining:
1. **Business DNA** - Your customer patterns, revenue cycles, workflows, and objectives
2. **Local Pulse** - Demographics, economic indicators, seasonal patterns, competitor activity  
3. **AI Foundation** - Large Language Models, pattern recognition, and decision algorithms

Our **Done-FOR-You** 4-week process: **Analyze → Build → Deploy → Optimize**

We focus on three high-impact areas: **Customer Visibility**, **Customer Communication**, and **Operational Efficiency**.
