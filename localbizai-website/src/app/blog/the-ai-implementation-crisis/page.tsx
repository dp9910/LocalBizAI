              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We're witnessing the most significant technological shift since the internet, yet it's creating an unprecedented economic divide. While Big Tech celebrates astronomical AI-driven profits, Main Street entrepreneurs—the backbone of our economy—are struggling to harness even basic AI capabilities. This isn't just a technology gap; it's an existential threat to small business competitiveness.
              </p>
            </div>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The numbers tell a stunning story of AI success at the enterprise level:
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong className="text-green-800">NVIDIA's meteoric rise</strong> showcases the raw financial power of the AI revolution.

                But here's where the story takes a troubling turn. While enterprise users celebrate these wins, small businesses face a completely different reality. According to <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/small-business-ai-adoption-jumps-68-owners-plan-significant-workforce-growth-2025" className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-800 font-semibold">Goldman Sachs' comprehensive survey of 10,000 small businesses</a>, despite AI adoption jumping from 51% to 68% in just two years, the implementation challenges are staggering:

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
