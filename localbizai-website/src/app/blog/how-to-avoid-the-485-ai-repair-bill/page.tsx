        <p className="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">The promise of AI is alluring: instant content, automated tasks, and intelligent insights. But for many small businesses, the reality is a costly lesson in what can go wrong. The infamous "$485 AI Repair Bill" has become a symbol of AI implementation gone awry. This is the average cost to fix a website crashed by faulty AI-generated code. But the damage can be far greater, from lost revenue to a tarnished brand reputation. In this post, we'll explore why generic AI tools are backfiring and how you can avoid becoming another statistic.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">The Pitfalls of Generic AI</h2>
          <p className="mt-6">
            The market is flooded with AI tools, each promising to be the magic bullet for your business. The problem is that these tools are generic. They lack the context and understanding of your specific business, industry, and customers. This leads to a host of problems:

          <ul className="mt-8 max-w-xl space-y-8 text-gray-600">
            <li className="flex gap-x-3">
              <span>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Faulty Code and Website Crashes.</strong> As mentioned, the $485 repair bill is a real consequence of using AI to generate code without proper oversight. A single error can bring your entire website down for days, resulting in lost sales and frustrated customers.

              <span>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">"Vanilla" Content That Falls Flat.</strong> AI-generated content often lacks the nuance, personality, and persuasive power of human writing. Professional writers report spending up to 90% of their time editing AI content to make it engaging and effective. This defeats the purpose of using AI in the first place.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex gap-x-3">
              <span>
                <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">No Measurable Impact.</strong> A study in Denmark found that 97% of businesses using generic AI tools saw no measurable changes in their earnings, hours worked, or overall satisfaction. This is because these tools are not aligned with specific business goals and KPIs.
