• Use basic sales forecasting to plan your inventory better

🚀 STEP 3: GUIDED SETUP
We set everything up for you and train your team. You don't touch any technical stuff. We test everything before it goes live so nothing breaks.

📈 STEP 4: RESULTS
• 30 days: Staff saves 2 hours daily on phone calls and messages
• 60 days: Customer complaints drop, reviews improve
• 90 days: Better inventory planning, less food waste
